# Roadmap

Current priorities for SwiftUIML. This is a rough guide, not a commitment - things may shift as the project evolves.

## Core Functionality

- **searchable** - Essential for any list-based app
- **refreshable** - Expected iOS UX pattern
- **task** - Modern async lifecycle (replaces onAppear anti-pattern)
- **onChange** - Forms are unusable without this
- **NavigationSplitView** - Required for iPad layouts
- **swipeActions** - Standard iOS list interaction

## Future

- **SceneKit support** - Add SceneView renderer for 3D content
- **Example project cleanup** - Improve the demo app and server to better showcase real-world usage
- **TypeScript/Swift DSL parity** - Close gaps between the two DSLs
- **Animation improvements** - Declarative easing, debouncing, transitions
- **Advanced views** - VideoPlayer, Chart integration, drag & drop, Canvas/Path drawing
